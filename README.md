Creating a flappy bird spin off game to learn how to use processing.org


In order to run this game you need to download processing.org from https://processing.org/download (82 KB)


This seems to be depreciated                                                                                                                                                          
You must also have the image files in the right file path. You need to create an img folder int the \processing-4.0b2-windows64\processing-4.0b2 folder which you get from the download above. It should look like this image if done correctly.

![File Path](./img/FilePathExample.PNG)

You may need to move the img folder from this github folder to the folder mentioned above.
